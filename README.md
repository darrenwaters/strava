Analysis of my personal Strava data (running)

This repository contains my Strava data (running only) exported from the app to Excel. I wanted to use the data as a source for learning more about functions and in particular if I could extract any findings from the data.

The downloaded data is attached. 

My first step was to clean the data by creating a copy into a new sheet, and sorting the data by activity type to remove non-running activities. I then removed columns where there was either no data or the data wasn't relevant.

I wanted to find out the following:

* On which day of the week have I run most often?
* On which day of the week have I run the most miles?
* On which day of the week was I, on average, running the fastest?
* How has my running behaviour and performance changed over time - noting that between 2016 and 2019 I had to largely stop running due to injuries?
